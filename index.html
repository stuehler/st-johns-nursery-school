				<h1>Welcome!</h1>

Our program is rich with language, social, cognitive, and motor development activities. We create a secure and nurturing environment to support the individual growth of each of our students. We are licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care.</p>
				<h1>Our Mission</h1>
				<p>St. John&rsquo;s Nursery School is an EEC licensed preschool program that was established to meet the needs of the three and four-year old nursery school child. St. John&rsquo;s has served young children for <em>over 45 years</em> in Westwood. The curriculum has been designed to provide a diverse and creative learning experience.. Our program provides the structure that each child needs, yet is flexible enough to allow room for individual creativity.We are especially proud of our Literacy Program which provides an added dimension to the SJNS experience. Children grow into relationships with their peers, while being subtly directed by an attentive and dedicated staff.</p>
				<h1>Our Goals</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>To be a safe and nurturing place for children to learn and grow, and become more independent.</li>
					<li>To respect the cultural backgrounds of our families.</li>
					<li>To encourage each child to be inquisitive.</li>

				<h1>History</h1>
				<p>St. John&rsquo;s Nursery School has been open since 1972, providing a continuous nursery school experience in the Westwood community. In 2015 our &ldquo;sister school&rdquo;, the Clapboardtree Nursery School, merged with SJNS and we have been operating together since then. The logos of these two schools were also merged; St. Johns&rsquo; child with a wagon, and Clapboardtree&rsquo;s tree with a heart. This is the logo you see today.</p>
