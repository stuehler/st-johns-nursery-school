				<h1>Programs</h1>
				<p>St. John&rsquo;s Nursery School offers a specialized program tailored to the needs of three- and four-year old students. We offer a low student-to-teacher ratio for the most effective learning environment, ensuring that your child is given every opportunity to succeed. Additionally, children benefit from instruction delivered in small groups as well as one-on-one situations.</p>
				<p>Various enrichment programs are also offered throughout the year. Specialists in music, movement, science and literacy frequently visit the school. Regular visits from our local librarian make story time extra special.</p>
				<p>We are fortunate to have our own Literacy Specialist on staff full-time, who regularly works with students in small groups and writes a monthly literacy newsletter for parents which provides information on early and pre-reading skills as well as a recommended reading list.</p>

				<!-- <h2 class="programs">Afternoon Adventures</h2> -->
				<!-- <p>The &ldquo;Afternoon Adventures&rdquo; program is a one hour extended day option offered to all children in the four-year old classroom each day Monday &ndash; Thursday from 1:00 &ndash; 2:00pm. Children bring their lunch and enjoy activity choices including free play areas, stories and/or project, and social time with friends. This is a relaxing and fun opportunity for your child to extend their day!</p> -->
				<p>Please send your child in with a nutritious lunch and drink (water or juice) in a separate bag or lunch box, from their usual daily snack. You can also choose to send a snack, with their lunch, as long as it is labeled clearly in their lunch box.</p>
				<h1>Curriculum</h1>
				<p>We believe in an early childhood experience that focuses on the social, emotional, cognitive and physical (gross and fine motor) development of our students. Each day children have opportunities to work in large groups, small groups, one-on-one with a teacher or friend, and independently.</p>
				<p>We follow the MA State Guidelines for Preschool Learning Experiences and the MA Curriculum Frameworks for Pre-K, for all subject areas. These subject areas include: Literacy, Science, Math, Social/Emotional Development, Health Education, Arts/Music and Technology.</p>
				<p>We use a theme-based curriculum. We have seasonal themes as well as other themes which include, Author Studies, Space, Transportation and Dinosaurs. We change the areas of the classroom to correspond with the themes. We also read books and do other theme related activities.</p>
				<p>To learn more about our Four Year old programs, we're proud to feature these multimedia presentations by our Director, Kris Blue:</p>

				<h1>Parent Testimonials</h1>
				<blockquote class="testimonial">I had 3 children go through St. John&rsquo;s and Clapboardtree Nursery Schools and couldn't be happier with the overall experience. The teachers were wonderful, the curriculum was great and both me and my children made some lasting friendships there. I would highly recommend it to all my friends with preschool age children.</blockquote>
				<p class="attribution">&mdash;Deena</p>
				<blockquote class="testimonial">St. John&rsquo;s and Clapboardtree had the experienced and nurturing teachers that made a difference in my children&rsquo;s nursery school experiences. They offer a loving, fun and safe academic experience. Our children had fun and were also prepared for the social and academic aspects of kindergarten.</blockquote>
				<p class="attribution">&mdash;Sheila</p>
				<blockquote class="testimonial"><span>Director Kris Blue cares deeply for her students and the school. She is very kind, conscientious, and experienced, with a truly impressive academic and experiential background. She inspires the kids to grow exponentially through the carefully honed curriculum and special learning time with each child. She also encourages kids to become more independent, sending them off to kindergarten with impressive self-help skills. I love her communication with the families; her weekly newsletter and photographs of the students are a fantastic way to partner with parents.</span></blockquote>
