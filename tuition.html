				<h2>Tuition Policy</h2>
				<p>Once your child has a confirmed spot in one of the classes, you will be notified by email the night of lottery, or by the Registrar, if a spot opens at a later date.</p>
				<p>In order to confirm your child's placement, please send the $200 non-refundable deposit along with the attached Enrollment Confirmation Form and a photocopy of your child's birth certificate to St. John&rsquo;s Nursery School by the deadline, which is two weeks after you are notified. If we do not receive all of these documents postmarked by the due date, we will make the space available to the next child on the waiting list.</p>
				<h2>Refund of Tuition</h2>
				<p>All tuition refund requests are required to be in writing. All refunds will be considered less the $200 tuition deposit, which is non-refundable. If a new paying student fills your child's vacancy, a refund will be granted. In the event of multiple student withdrawals from SJNS, refunds will be issued in the order of the receipt of the student's letter of withdrawal. SJNS will make every attempt to fill the spot with a paying student before it is donated, if applicable. If a full paying student does not fill the vacancy, no refund of tuition paid to date will be given.</p>
				<p>Any registered student who is&hellip;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Up to date with all tuition payments and withdraws between the 2 weeks prior to school and the 1st day of school or any registered student who withdraws after the first day of the school year forfeits any fees or tuition paid to date. Tuition refund requests are required to be in writing.</li>
					<li>Not up to date with all tuition payments by the first of May will have their case reviewed by the Board in order to determine if their spot and tuition paid to date will be forfeited.</li>
					<li>Not up to date with all tuition payments and has been working with the Board in regards to payments two weeks prior to the start of school will have their case reviewed by the Board in order to determine if that spot and tuition paid to date will be forfeited.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>St. John&rsquo;s reserves the right, in its absolute and sole discretion, to decide whether to fill any vacancy. Any withdrawal <em>must be in writing</em> and mailed to St. John&rsquo;s Nursery School, 95 Deerfield Ave., Westwood, MA, 02090.</p>
